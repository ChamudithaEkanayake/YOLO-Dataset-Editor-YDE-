# YOLO-Dataset-Editor-YDE-
This tool addresses a critical gap in the YOLO annotation pipelineâ€”the lack of editability after dataset export. By enabling fast correction and refinement of bounding boxes, the application helps researchers, engineers, and students maintain high-quality datasets, ultimately improving model training and performance.
